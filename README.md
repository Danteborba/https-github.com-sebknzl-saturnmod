Saturn Switchless Mod
=====================

This is the PIC-code needed for the Switchless Mod as described at http://knzl.de/saturnmod/ .

For flashing a 16F630/16F676, you will only need the .hex-file, the rest is
the source-code needed for rebuilding it.

Building
--------

For rebuilding, you'll need:

 * Microchip MPLAB IDE (FREE)
 * HI-TECH C Compiler, you can use the free "lite" version or the demo
